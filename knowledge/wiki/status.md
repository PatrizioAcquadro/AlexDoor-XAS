# Project Status

Current as of 2026-10-03 UTC. **6.0B is maintained; prior dynamic trackers are retired;
the CAD-free Point2Pose prototype is implemented but unqualified. Phase 6.0 and
6.1 remain open.** No training, new corpus or sealed-test evaluation was started.

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| 4 — Purdue runtime | Seven-joint A1, full-pose A2/A3, WSG32/UMI v1, synchronized head RGB-D/proprioception and contact diagnostics. Common zero-yaw setup is maintained. |
| 5 — Corpus | Complete: 32 qualified doors, 12 reviewed families and frozen 19 train / 6 development / 7 test. Rights: 29 redistributable, two local-only, one private/noncommercial. |
| 6.0A/B — Contracts and static evidence | Operational/local support, explicit selection, admission and feedback interfaces retained. Static object fusion, ownership alternatives, hinge hypotheses, finite-cover and relevant-space queries maintained. Neither interfaces nor scans admit motion. |
| 6.0C — Panel tracking prototype | Official CUDA pipeline, FK compensation, panel-fixed zones, causal queues and full process reset implemented. Four pilot replays and eight fresh Isaac cases fail useful availability at 0%; latency and some raw accuracy fail. No qualified runtime or loaded contact. |
| 6.0D–H — Contact and qualification | Feedback/load/stop, independent chosen-contact scoring, bounded interaction and complete qualification remain future work. |
| 6.1 — Action paths | ACT/Diffusion × A1–A4, observed-input/data contracts and execution/replay software maintained. Numerical/CUDA preparation is distinct from pending qualified-provider integration and physical validation. |
| 6.2–7 — Policy data and learning | Not started. No matched B1 policy dataset or learned-policy result. |

## Next action

Resolve the observed runtime/support failures of the
[[implementation_phases/phase-6-0-operational-perception-and-contact|6.0C prototype]]
against the preserved pilot replay and observer results. Frozen source `7460963`
fails all four replay and eight observer useful-availability gates. Live complete
latency p95 is 0.784–1.755 s; some raw right-pilot poses also exceed 1 cm/5 degrees.
CUDA execution and full process resets work, but no sustained useful interval or
useful recovery is validated. Profile evidenced initialization/multi-hypothesis
cost and candidate consistency before broadening validation.
Use the fixed 95% useful availability and p95 1 cm/5 degree criteria; a provider
that always returns unavailable fails. Preserve every failed attempt and modify
Point2Pose only for evidenced limitations.

Tracking alone establishes neither ownership, a physical hinge nor safe contact.
D must verify continuous relevant sweeps, feedback semantics, response/load
uncertainty, compliance and stop bounds. E must independently score the selected
material contact. Pilot offline and feedback/stop gates precede bounded pilot
interaction; all train/development offline gates precede qualification dynamics.
Both qualification groups and explicit release compatibility precede 6.1 handoff.
The 1 cm / 5 degree and per-door 95% coverage/precision gates are unchanged.

## Resources and material limits

All 50 `engineering-v2` episodes retain original calibration/metadata for static
work and future common train/development qualification. Superseded campaigns,
derived caches, temporary experiment scripts and repeated payloads were removed;
headers, corrected per-door results, significant failures and decisive images remain
under `outputs/b1/perception/evidence/`. Its `cleanup.json` records removals and
relocations. Removed ignored payloads cannot be recovered from Git.
Selected GroundingDINO/SAM3/DINOv3 resources and their image-worker overlay remain.
Prepared assets, corpus/splits, qualification evidence and `knowledge/raw/` are intact.

Static scans preserve ambiguous whole-object ownership and unobserved physical
axes. Human confirmation assigns only the displayed pilot regions to the leaf;
endpoint IK and free-space balls do not validate a path or loaded control.
Current recordings lack torque and the observed monitor rejects loaded execution.
Depth is ideal; camera mounting and hardware feedback/stopping are unvalidated.
Train contains one 15-door residential family and development one right-hand door;
report per-door/handedness results without population claims. The sealed test stays closed.

[[experiments/b1-perception-findings|Historical findings]] retain train fitting with
0/6 development qualification, corrected component scores, interrupted campaigns
and the failed material-tracking exits. They do not justify another training run.
B0 remains historical: the saturated 576-rollout study selected no winner and its
219.95 N event remains under review.

Supported entry points are documented in the root/model READMEs: runtime and
corpus verification, intake/preparation/qualification, recording, frozen image
smoke, static scan diagnosis and Point2Pose smoke/replay/observer diagnostics.
No estimator training or tracker-comparison CLI is supplied. See
